THIS WAS TESTED ON MATLAB 2019a. NO GUARANTEES THAT IT WORKS ON OTHER VERSIONS OF MATLAB.

To compile the simulator, navigate into the Bloch_Simulator directory and type:

mex mex_blochsim.cpp mexsimulator.cpp magnetization.cpp event_manager.cpp;

into the Matlab command line and press enter. 

Assuming there are no errors, it is now ready to go.
