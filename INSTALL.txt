THIS WAS TESTED ON MATLAB 2017b. NO GUARANTEES THAT IT WORKS ON OTHER VERSIONS OF MATLAB OR WITH OTHER CUDA COMPUTE CAPABILITY. It was also tested on the gpu4gar.cmrr.umn.edu server. No guarantees it will work otherwise.

In matlab, type the following to set the path to the nvidia compiler: 

Linux:
setenv('MW_NVCC_PATH','/opt/local/cuda-8.0/bin/')

Windows (adapt the v10.2 to your version):
setenv('MW_NVCC_PATH','C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v10.2\bin')

If you want to avoid doing this everytime you open Matlab, in Matlab's command window, type:

edit ~/Documents/MATLAB/startup.m

Copy and paste the setenv(...) line from above into this file. Save and close the file. Now every time you open Matlab, it will run startup.m first.

To compile the simulator, navigate into the Bloch_Simulator directory and type:

mexcuda mex_blochsim.cu mexsimulator.cu magnetization.cu event_manager.cu -dynamic;

into the Matlab command line and press enter. 

Assuming there are no errors, it is now ready to go.
